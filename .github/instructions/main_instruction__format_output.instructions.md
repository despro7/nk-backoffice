# Project Context
This project, "nova-field," is a comprehensive web application designed to manage and synchronize orders and product data between a local database and an external systems (WordPress website, Dilovod, SalesDrive). The application is built using TypeScript and leverages Prisma for database management. It includes both client-side and server-side components, with a focus on efficient data handling, caching, and user interface design.

# Coding Guidelines
1. **TypeScript Usage**: Ensure all code is written in TypeScript, utilizing strong typing for variables, function parameters, and return types to enhance code reliability and maintainability.
2. **Database Management**: Use Prisma ORM for all database interactions. Follow best practices for schema design, migrations, and data querying to ensure efficient and scalable database operations.
3. **Code Structure**: Maintain a clear separation between client-side and server-side code. Organize files and directories logically to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the codebase.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout the application. Use try-catch blocks where appropriate and provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on optimizing performance, especially in data-intensive operations such as caching and synchronization with Dilovod/SalesDrive. Use efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize latency and resource consumption.
6. **User Interface**: Design user interfaces that are intuitive and user-friendly. Follow modern UI/UX principles to ensure a positive user experience.
7. **Documentation**: Document code thoroughly, including function descriptions, parameter explanations, and usage examples. Maintain up-to-date documentation for the overall architecture and key components of the application.
